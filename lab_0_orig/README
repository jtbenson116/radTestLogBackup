 LAB 0 README
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

This lab requires the following prerequisites:
- Device drivers, fw and libs are properly installed
- GVML libs are properly installed

This lab's purpose is to introduce the development environment to the user. By the end of the lab the user should understand:
- how to use ledag-ssh: inspecting APU boards connected to the host machine, rebooting them, configuring them etc.
- program flow:
    - defining an interface between the device and the host machine
    - using the GDL to send tasks from the host machine to the device and to retrieve the results from the device
- how to debug: using minicom (or ledag-ssh if minicom is not available) to view logs from the device

This lab contains a Makefile to build gsi_device_lab_0. You can choose to build in debug (make mode=debug) or release mode (make mode=release).
Calling make mode=debug will create a build directory with the following structure:

build/
└── debug
    ├── gsi_device_lab_0              # the lab's executable
    ├── gsi_device_lab_0.a
    ├── gsi_device_lab_0_apuc_code.o
    ├── gsi_device_lab_0.bin
    ├── gsi_device_lab_0_defs.c
    ├── gsi_device_lab_0_defs.h
    ├── gsi_device_lab_0.mod
    ├── gsi_device_lab_0_module.o
    └── gsi_device_lab_0.s

To run the lab on the host machine,
  ./gsi_device_lab_0

This lab is accompanied by an online recording / presentation.
